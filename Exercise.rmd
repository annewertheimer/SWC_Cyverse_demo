## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r get-data}
gap.in <- read.csv("http://naupaka.net/files/gapminder.csv")
Afg<-subset(gap.in, country == "Afghanistan")
UK<-subset(gap.in, country == "United Kingdom")
US<-subset(gap.in, country == "United States")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r scatter}
plot(Afg$year,Afg$gdpPercap)
mean(Afg$gdpPercap)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
